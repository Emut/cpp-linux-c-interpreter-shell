# cpp-linux-c-interpreter-shell
Umut Ekici - 2018

UNDER CONSTRUCTION - First version gonna be here before 2019!

Inspired by the vxworks c interpreter shell. 

Call functions and existing variables or create new variables from anywhere, as simple c strings, including the terminal screen. 

#include? Who needs it anyway...
